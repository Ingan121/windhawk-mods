## 1.4.7 ([Dec 18, 2024](https://github.com/ramensoftware/windhawk-mods/blob/28f831fb2eb390551fac6fa88ca6bf6c590fac01/mods/explorer-details-better-file-sizes.wh.cpp))

* "Everything" integration for folder sizes: Added support for folder junctions.

## 1.4.6 ([Dec 16, 2024](https://github.com/ramensoftware/windhawk-mods/blob/4daa0db637b47f3da820ad7d1cdcc64236068d12/mods/explorer-details-better-file-sizes.wh.cpp))

* "Everything" integration for folder sizes: Added support for the new Everything SDK3. With "Everything" version 1.5.0.1384a or newer, the folder size query is much faster now (can be around 20x faster).
* "Everything" integration for folder sizes: Folder junctions no longer have a size (zero size was shown before).
* Fixed sorting folders by size when the "Mix files and folders when sorting by size" option is disabled.
* Folder sizes are now displayed in more places, including "Library" folders and the details pane.
* Fixed a rare mod hang on unload.

## 1.4.5 ([Dec 4, 2024](https://github.com/ramensoftware/windhawk-mods/blob/1c07c82111a8cfb4c2a1757f702e598172570193/mods/explorer-details-better-file-sizes.wh.cpp))

* Fixed Explorer hanging when Open Path is used in Everything.
* Excluded Plex Media Server which is incompatible, a proper fix will be implemented later.
* Added support for older Windows 10 versions.

## 1.4.4 ([Nov 10, 2024](https://github.com/ramensoftware/windhawk-mods/blob/f396f78d645dc57089bf4805a63b0bd82f50d745/mods/explorer-details-better-file-sizes.wh.cpp))

* Fixed the "Mix files and folders when sorting by size" option that stopped working in version 1.4.2.

## 1.4.3 ([Nov 10, 2024](https://github.com/ramensoftware/windhawk-mods/blob/49e105f33c5fef9363a0dae4f6e12a9b5ec31746/mods/explorer-details-better-file-sizes.wh.cpp))

* Excluded Plex which is incompatible, a proper fix will be implemented later.
* Excluded conhost to reduce possible conflicts, the mod isn't relevant for it anyway.
* Improved the workaround to the error message that says "Runtime Error - Not Enough space for thread Data" to cover more (hopefully all) cases.

## 1.4.2 ([Nov 9, 2024](https://github.com/ramensoftware/windhawk-mods/blob/319700c1152b5e0d664b6832eff4bb003d92dfee/mods/explorer-details-better-file-sizes.wh.cpp))

* Fixed the mod interfering with file size calculation in operations such as copying folders.
* Added a workaround to the error message that says "Runtime Error - Not Enough space for thread Data". The error could occur when a process is shutting down due to a somewhat specific incompatibility between the Microsoft C++ runtime library and Windhawk's C++ library. It's not really harmful, as the process is shutting down anyway, but it can be annoying.

## 1.4.1 ([Nov 9, 2024](https://github.com/ramensoftware/windhawk-mods/blob/a338ea9f84db30284a1e95afd8475423e389ef58/mods/explorer-details-better-file-sizes.wh.cpp))

* Fixed elevated processes being unable to receive folder sizes from Everything, causing a timeout and missing folder sizes.
* Made the "Use MB/GB for large files" option work for older file dialogs too, for example Regedit's export dialog.

## 1.4 ([Nov 8, 2024](https://github.com/ramensoftware/windhawk-mods/blob/8a97216088069321df239b51174247ec6342138c/mods/explorer-details-better-file-sizes.wh.cpp))

* Added an option to mix files and folders when sorting by size.

## 1.3 ([Nov 8, 2024](https://github.com/ramensoftware/windhawk-mods/blob/404f046ed97d3f4f50c777b774419268c318de7a/mods/explorer-details-better-file-sizes.wh.cpp))

* The integration with Everything was rewritten and is now faster (about x6 speedup), more stable (occasional hangs were fixed), and more robust overall.

## 1.2.1 ([Nov 7, 2024](https://github.com/ramensoftware/windhawk-mods/blob/2d7a490c8540c53e5c97f7b8f96789c2a96d5fd4/mods/explorer-details-better-file-sizes.wh.cpp))

* Added support for Everything 1.5 alpha.

* Added an option for getting folder sizes via "Everything" integration, which results in immediate folder sizes without having to calculate them manually.
* Improved the performance of sorting folders by size.

## 1.1 ([Oct 31, 2024](https://github.com/ramensoftware/windhawk-mods/blob/0948b033c97db8abadfab78beffec4628a3924e0/mods/explorer-details-better-file-sizes.wh.cpp))

* Added an option to show folder sizes too.
