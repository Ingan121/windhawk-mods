## 1.0.1 ([Jul 30, 2025](https://github.com/ramensoftware/windhawk-mods/blob/7c1f5a38df8f51277a6b4bb1d7bd0b0e408063c2/mods/classic-winver.wh.cpp))

- Hide divider when no about bitmap in 7+ layout
  - This behavior is accurate to the real implementation, and is
    especially needed since `BrandingLoadImage` is seemingly broken
    outside of `winver.exe` in recent Windows 11 builds
